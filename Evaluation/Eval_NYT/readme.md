<h2> Evulation on NYT-FB dataset</h2>
To run the script on the sample data for relation: 

```
/people/person/place_of_birth
```

Install the two packages SparqlWraper and pandas. Run the main script to generate the relations and then run the evaluation script to produce the results.

For another relation, type changes the relationship type in the evaluation script and run the code. (The first step is always the main script to extract relations).

The complete dataset with default annotation is available on KAGGLE. To change the default annotation, use the AllenAnnotation script to annotate for NEs.
