<h2> Evulation on NYT-FB dataset</h2>
To run the script on the sample data for relation: <i>/people/person/place_of_birth</i> just install the two packages SparqlWraper and pandas. Run the main script to generate the relations and then run the evulation script to produce the results. 

 For other relation type just change the relation type in the evluation script and run the code. (The first step is always main script to extract relations).

 The complete dataset with defult annotation are available on [KAGGLE](https://www.kaggle.com/duongthanhhung/nyt-relation-extraction).
 To change the defult annotation, use the AllenAnnotation script to annotate for NEs.
